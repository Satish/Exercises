1. select all articles whose author is user3.

SELECT * from articles where user='User Three'


2. For all the articles being selected above, select all the articles and also the comments associated with those articles in a single query

SELECT articles.*, comments.description FROM articles LEFT JOIN comments ON articles.title=comments.article WHERE articles.user = 'User Three'



3. Write a query to select all articles which do not have any comments

SELECT articles.*, comments.description as comment_desc FROM comments RIGHT JOIN articles on comments.article = articles.title WHERE comments.description IS NULL


4. Write a query to select article which has maximum comments

SELECT articles.*, count(*) FROM comments JOIN articles on articles.title = comments.article GROUP BY article ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1



5. Write a query to select article which does not have more than one comment by the same user ( do this using left join and also do it using group by )
